  description: "My name is Luciano Senekal, and I’m a professional, enthusiastic programmer with a passion for problem-solving and a self-driven approach to learning. I specialize in JavaScript, Java, and Flutter, and I enjoy working across a range of web application development stacks to make technology accessible and open to everyone. Over the years, I’ve developed a variety of impactful projects, from eCommerce integrations with ERP systems to automated sales solutions that read client emails and generate quotes. I also led the development of a mobile app for event check-ins and networking, built with Flutter and Dart, and available on AWS, the Google Play Store, and the Apple App Store. I’m open to opportunities that align with my skills and drive for innovation.",
